## Open the Jupyter Notebook on Google Colab

There are two ways you can do this. I'll provide instructions for both methods below.

1. Download the notebook to your computer, upload it to Google Drive, and open it in Google Colab from Google Drive.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook in Google Colab directly from GitHub.

### 1. Upload to Google Drive

* Ctrl-Click on the .ipynb file to open it in a new tab.
* Click on the download button to download it to your machine. (It looks like a tray with an arrow pointing down into it.)

* Once you paste the URL in the box, any Jupyter Notebooks inside the repository main branch will appear in the list.
* Click on the desired notebook.

#### Save completed file back to GitHub repository

If you opened the notebook in Google Colaboratory directly from GitHub, you can save the completed file directly there again.

* Go to File - Save a copy in GitHub
