## Open the Jupyter Notebook on Google Colab

There are two ways you can do this. I'll provide instructions for both methods below.

1. Download the notebook to your computer, upload it to Google Drive, and open it in Google Colab from Google Drive.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook in Google Colab directly.

### 1. Upload to Google Drive

* Ctrl-Click on the .ipynb file to open it in a new tab.
* Click on the download button to download it to your machine. (It looks like a tray with an arrow pointing down into it.)
